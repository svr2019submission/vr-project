# ACL defect prediction

An approach for predicting defect proneness on unlabeled datasets- Average Clustering and Labeling (ACL).

ACL models get good prediction performance and are comparable to typical supervised learning models in terms of F-measure. ACL offers a viable choice for defect prediction on unlabeled dataset.

This implementation is based in the following paper:
